Inspired by <a href="https://medium.com/@edwardbenson/how-i-hacked-amazon-s-5-wifi-button-to-track-baby-data-794214b0bdd8">this article</a> but since I have an Intel Edison lying around, and I can compile a binary for the Edison... I'm doing it in Go.

Eventually (or maybe not that long from now) this will allow me to trigger events in the real world, basically anything that I can hook up to an Edison (which means all Arduino/Seed/etc boards).
